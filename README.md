# My Data Science Projects

This repository contains various data science projects I have worked on, showcasing my skills in Python, data analysis, and machine learning.

## Projects

### Project 1: Employee Attrition Prediction
- **Objective**: Predict employee attrition using machine learning models.
### Libraries
- **Pandas,NumPy,Matplotlib & Seaborn,Scikit-learn,Statsmodels**:

### Methods
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizing distributions and relationships using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.
  - Correlation analysis to identify relationships between features.
- **Model Building**:
  - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
  - Building various classification models:
    - **Logistic Regression**: For baseline modeling.
    - **Random Forest Classifier**: For its robustness and performance.
    - **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: For advanced boosting techniques.
  - Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`.
- **Details**: [Project 1 Details](Copy_of_Case_4_Employee_Attrition_with_Random_Forest.ipynb)

### Project 2:Predicting House_Prices with Linear Regression
- **Objective**: Forecast sales using time series analysis.
- **Technologies**: Python, Statsmodels, Seaborn, Excel
- **Details**: [Project 2 Details](Copy_of_Predicting_House_Prices.ipynb)
