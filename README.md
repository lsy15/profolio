# My Data Science Projects

This repository contains various data science projects I have worked on, showcasing my skills in Python, data analysis, and machine learning.


## Project 1: Employee Attrition Prediction
- **Objective**: Predict employee attrition using machine learning models.
- **Libraries**:
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib & Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels**

### Methods
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizing distributions and relationships using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.
  - Correlation analysis to identify relationships between features.
- **Model Building**:
  - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
  - Building various classification models:
    - **Logistic Regression**: For baseline modeling.
    - **Random Forest Classifier**: For its robustness and performance.
    - **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: For advanced boosting techniques.
  - Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`.

## Project 2:Predicting House_Prices with Linear Regression
- **Objective**:  Predict house prices in King County based on specific characteristics using a linear regression model.
- **Methods**: Python, Pandas, Statsmodels, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Details**: [Project 2 Details](Copy_of_Predicting_House_Prices.ipynb)

## Project 3: Predicting Toyota Corolla Prices with Neural Networks

**Objective:** Predict the price of Toyota Corolla cars using a neural network, focusing on the impact of training epochs on model performance.

**Technologies:** Data Mining in Excel

**Details:**
- **Data Used:** Features of Toyota Corolla cars, including but not limited to engine size, fuel type, and mileage.
- **Model:** Neural Network trained using the Data Mining package within Excel.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - **RMS (Root Mean Square Error):** Measures the average magnitude of the prediction errors. Decreases as the number of epochs increases.
  - **R² (Coefficient of Determination):** Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Increases as the number of epochs increases.

**Conclusion:** The model primarily aims to predict the price of Toyota Corolla cars. Performance metrics suggest that increasing the number of epochs improves the model's accuracy and predictive capability, although practical limitations should be considered.

## Project 4: Break-Even Analysis and Profit Optimization for Athena I Bicycles

**Objective:** Perform a break-even analysis of Athena I bicycle sales and determine the optimal product mix among four Athena bicycle models to maximize company profits.

**Technologies:** Microsoft Excel 

**Details:**
- **Data Used:** Sales data for four Athena bicycle models, including costs and revenues.
- **Analysis Method:**
  - **Break-Even Analysis:** Calculated to determine the point at which total revenues equal total costs.
  - **Optimization:** Used Excel’s Solver tool to find the optimal product mix that maximizes profits.

**Findings:**
- **Solver Result:** A solution was found that satisfies all constraints and optimality conditions.
- **Pivot Table Analysis:** Generated to visualize the product mix and profit distribution.
